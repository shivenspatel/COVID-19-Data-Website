# COVID-19 Data Website
A Python project that visualizes COVID-19 data at the federal and state/county level. Includes graphs (bokeh) and maps (folium).

<h1>File Structure:</h1>
main.py - Main file; generates all graphs and maps in their respective folders.

loopgenerator.py - deprecated

codegenerator.py - meant to generate functions to paste into flask file; generates each state's webpage.

mainpagemap.py - generates map displayed on entry page.

usgenerator.py - generates all graphs for national data.

execute.py - used on AWS server as a single file to run all necessary commands to update data daily with cron

<h2>How This Website is Built:</h2>
All of the graphs and maps on this website are generated by various Python scripts. Data is pulled in from various sources into Pandas DataFrames. The data is then cleaned, formatted, and cut according to my needs. The graphs are generated through the Bokeh library, and the maps are generated through Folium. All are saved into folders on the system, and each is displayed in iframes on the various sections of the website. The microweb framework used is Flask, also written in Python. The web server is Apache, and the whole website is running on an AWS Ubuntu server. More information and the code is available on the GitHub page for this website.
            
<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<b><a href="https://covidtracking.com/"><i>The Atlantic</i>’s COVID Tracking Project</a></b> is the source for most of the COVID-19 related data on the graphs. This includes cases, deaths, testing and hospitalizations. The nationwide maps on the home page also come from COVID Tracking Project data. Death rate and positivity rate are calculated from this data by my own algorithm.

<a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/"><b>Google’s COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports</b></a> are the source for the mobility data graphs.

<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-county-data-us.html"><i><b>The New York Times</b></i></a> is the source for county level data seen on maps in state section

Vaccine data comes from the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/b7pe-5nws"><b>US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</b></a>.

Unemployment Data comes from the <b><a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></b>

<h2>Note on Vaccine Data</h2>
<u>“This dataset lists the allocations of doses made available for states and jurisdictions to order against. Weekly allocations are provided to states on Tuesdays; after doses are ordered by states, shipments begin the following Monday. The entire order may not arrive in one shipment or on one day, but over the course of the week”</u> – <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/saz5-9hgg">CDC</a>; Vaccine data shown in graphs is allocated vaccines, not administered vaccines.
